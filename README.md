GNUstep Android Toolchain
=========================

This project comprises a collection of scripts to build a GNUstep toolchain for Android. The toolchain can then be used in an Android project to compile and run Objective-C code using the Foundation library.

The toolchain is built using the compiler and tools provided by the standard Android SDK and NDK (installed e.g. via [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio)). It is currently set up to target `armeabi-v7a` and Android API level 21 (5.0 / Lollipop).

Libraries
---------

The toolchain currently compiles the following libraries for Android:

* [GNUstep Base Library](https://github.com/gnustep/libs-base)
* [libobjc2](https://github.com/gnustep/libobjc2)
* [libdispatch](https://github.com/apple/swift-corelibs-libdispatch) (official Apple release from the Swift Core Libraries)

Requirements
------------

The following options need to be installed via the Android SDK Manager (e.g. via Android Studio):

* Android 5.0 (Lollipop / API level 21) SDK Platform _– or other SDK Platform as specified in [sdkenv.sh](env/sdkenv.sh)_
* Android SDK Build-Tools
* LLDB
* CMake _– version 3.10.2.4988404 as specified in [sdkenv.sh](env/sdkenv.sh)_
* Android SDK Platform-Tools
* Android SDK Tools
* NDK

Currently supported platforms are: macOS and Linux.  Other platforms to come.

Usage
-----

Run the [build.sh](build.sh) script to build the toolchain:

```
./build.sh
```

The toolchain is installed into `~/Library/Android/GNUstep` (`$GNUSTEP_HOME`).

To use the toolchain from an Android project, you can use `$GNUSTEP_HOME/bin/gnustep-config` to obtain various flags that should be used to compile and link Objective-C files, e.g.

* `gnustep-config --variable=CC`
* `gnustep-config --objc-flags` (or `--debug-flags`)
* `gnustep-config --base-libs`

Call `gnustep-config --help` to obtain the full list of available variables.

Examples
--------

The [android-examples](https://github.com/gnustep/android-examples) repository contains example projects using this project.

Future work
-----------

The following is an (incomplete) list of open work items:

* Add [libxml2](https://github.com/GNOME/libxml2) for NSXMLParser support in GNUstep Base
* Add support for arm64 architecture
* Add support for x86 architecture
